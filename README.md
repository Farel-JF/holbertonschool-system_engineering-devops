# Web Infrastructure Design

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and designing a web infrastructure. It covers essential concepts such as network basics, servers, web servers, DNS, load balancers, and monitoring. The goal is to build and explain a robust web stack and understand system redundancy and high availability.

## Concepts Covered

1. **Network Basics**: Understanding the fundamental concepts of networking including IP addresses, subnets, and routing.
2. **Server**: The role and configuration of servers in a web infrastructure.
3. **Web Server**: Functions and configuration of web servers.
4. **DNS**: Domain Name System and its role in translating domain names to IP addresses.
5. **Load Balancer**: Techniques and strategies for distributing traffic across multiple servers.
6. **Monitoring**: Tools and practices for monitoring the performance and health of a web infrastructure.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Draw and explain a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects.
- Explain the function and importance of each component in your web infrastructure.
- Understand and describe system redundancy concepts.
- Recognize and explain acronyms such as LAMP, SPOF, and QPS.

## Requirements

### General Requirements

- **README.md**: A README file is mandatory and should be at the root of your project folder.
- **Diagrams**: For each task, you need to provide a diagram that illustrates your solution. Take a picture or screenshot of your whiteboard or digital diagram and include it in your project.
- **Manual QA Review**: After completing each task, request a manual QA review.

### Tasks

1. **Draw Your Web Stack**:
   - Create a diagram that includes all components of your web stack.
   - Explain what each component does and its role in the overall infrastructure.

2. **Explain System Redundancy**:
   - Describe how redundancy is achieved in your system to ensure high availability and minimize downtime.

3. **Understand Acronyms**:
   - **LAMP**: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python.
   - **SPOF**: Single Point of Failure.
   - **QPS**: Queries Per Second.

## Task Submission

1. **Screenshots**: Upload screenshots of your diagrams to an image hosting service like Imgur. Include the links in your answer file.
2. **GitHub**: After pushing your answer file to GitHub, provide the GitHub link in the URL box for review.

## Whiteboarding

- **Preparation**: Be ready to explain your diagrams and answers in front of a mentor, staff, or fellow student without the aid of notes or a computer.
- **Focus**: Answer the questions asked without going into unnecessary details. If needed, clarify with the interviewer if additional details are required.
